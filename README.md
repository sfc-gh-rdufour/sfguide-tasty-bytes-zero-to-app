# Build a Data App with Snowflake
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview 

Snowflake is a terrific platform on which to build data applications. The unique characteristics and
cloud-based design allow for building applications that scale with data and workload. This tutorial
will go through how to build and deploy both the Processing Layer and the User Interface Layer paired
with Snowflake as the Persistence Layer.

Our example will be using a fictional food truck franchise website, Tasty Bytes. We will be building
a graphical user interface with charts and graphs for franshisees to be able to examine sales data related
to their franchise of food trucks. After logging in via a login page, each franchisee will have one page 
that will show metrics at the franchise level, and another that will show metrics around the food truck 
brands for that franchise.

The Processing and User Interface Layers will be built using Node.js. The dataset is a orders history
for Tasty Bytes.
